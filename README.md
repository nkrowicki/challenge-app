# Frontend Challenge 

Frontend Challenge Built with:
- React
- Typescript
- Jest
- TailwindCSS
- Eslint
- Deploy to Netlify Platform.

## Information:

### Notes:

- I used the boilerplate https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate as I found it very complete and practical because it already included Eslint, Tailwindcss and Typescript.

- I used Tailwindcss simply to speed up the layout of the application, I could have done it with pure css/scss without problems. 

- Although it wasn't asked for in the brief, I used typescript to work in a neater and more robust way. 

- The tests were made only to some of the components because I tried to choose components which can be tested in different ways. (The way to test the rest of the components is "similar")

- I worked on a develop branch where all the commits are located and then that was merged to master.
